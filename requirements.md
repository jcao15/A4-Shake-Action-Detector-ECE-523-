# A4: Real-Time Sensor Processing 

Note: This is a duplicate of the instructions found on Canvas. If there is a discrepancy, follow the Canvas instructions. 

## What we're doing

Building an Android app to do something in response to sensors on the device. 

Specifically, we'll be implementing our own *shake detector* and *step counter*. 

This assignment is an individual assignment, to be implemented in Kotlin.

Note: For this assignment, you will want to use an actual phone to properly test your App.

## Why we're doing it
This assignment will help us become more familiar with using the hardware sensors in the phone and processing of sensory data in real time. 

There absolutely are existing tools, libraries, apps, etc. that do this stuff for us. But, we're starting with a relatively simple task, and building it ourselves, so we can extend our understanding and familiarity with how this works on Android. 

## How to do it

Please note that, while you are going to build only two functionalities in this assignment, they could apply to a wider range of applications. For example, for physical therapy or safety monitoring applications, serious games, and simply recreational activities.

***Please refer to the instructions on Canvas***


# Submission
Please push your A4 to your Github Classroom repo, and create a corresponding release. Your repo must contain the following items:

- Android Studio Project folder
- Folder called "imgs" or "screenshots"
- README.md file 
   - This file should serve as a quick writeup and description of what you built. As you write this up, you should think of it in terms of showing this off as part of a programming portfolio, and the reader is a potential employer who wants to quickly understand what you did with this project. Or at the least, an easy way for me to understand, and for you to remind yourself in the future. 
   - It should be written using Github markdown (Links to an external site.)
   - It should include: 
     - Your Name
     - Short description of what you built
     - Short instructions on how to use the app 
        - We're not going to focus **too** much this quarter on user experience and such, but it will be helpful to know what to look for.
     - Screenshots of your app, which are stored in a "screenshots" or "imgs" directory 
        - See the links above about taking screenshots or videos using Android Studio
     - Summary of why you chose this project, what you learned, what you found challenging or unexpected. You might include something you didn't finish or polish or would like to do different in the future. 

Submit a link to your Github Classroom repo on Canvas.
